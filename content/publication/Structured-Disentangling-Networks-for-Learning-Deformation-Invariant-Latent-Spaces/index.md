abstract: "Disentangling latent spaces is an important research direction in the interpretability of
unsupervised machine learning. Several recent works using deep learning are very effective
at producing disentangled representations. However, in the unsupervised setting, there is
no way to pre-specify which part of the latent space captures specific factors of variations.
While this is generally a hard problem because of the non-existence of analytical expressions to capture these variations, there are certain factors like geometric transforms that can
be expressed analytically. Furthermore, in existing frameworks, the disentangled values are
also not interpretable. The focus of this work is to disentangle these geometric factors of
variations (which turn out to be nuisance factors for many applications) from the semantic
content of the signal in an interpretable manner which in turn makes the features more discriminative. Experiments are designed to show the modularity of the approach with other
disentangling strategies as well as on multiple one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional
(2D) datasets, clearly indicating the efficacy of the proposed approach.
