title: "Edge Detection and Toolpath Generation for 3D Meshes"
summary: "This is an ongoing ARM funded project where the goal is to automate finishing tasks in manufacturing processes. In this project, we consider th specific case of edge deburring. My contribution is in developing the algorithm to perform edge detection on the mesh and then generate a toolpath along which the robot will perform the deburring operation. "
