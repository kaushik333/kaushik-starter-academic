I am a Research Engineer in Siemens Technology, Princeton, NJ. I work on Computer Vision and Machine Learning problems for various government-projects and business use-cases. I have been involved with a range of projects such as Anomaly Detection, Semi-supervised pose estimation, Point-cloud processing, Object detection and some Virtual-reality applications. Offlate I have been exploring the usage of generative models (VAEs and GANs) for high precision estimation problems. Prior to this, I got my MS in Electrical Engineering from Arizona State University.
